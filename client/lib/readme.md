Add client side libraries here.
You usually don't want to paste any libs here but install them from NPM instead!
(Unless they are not avaliable, like Leaflet.Sleep...)

To install from NPM, 
* get the name and the current revision
* add it to /packages.json
* reqire it to _deps in /client/lib/app.browserify.js (in this folder)
